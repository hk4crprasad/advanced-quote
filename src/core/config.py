Design a square motivational quote image with an authentic, tactile paper texture background. The paper should have:
- Realistic cream/off-white aged paper texture with visible paper fibers and subtle grain
- Natural paper imperfections like slight wrinkles, subtle stains, or worn edges
- Warm, soft lighting that creates gentle shadows and highlights on the paper surface
- A vintage, handwritten journal or notebook aesthetic

Typography:
- Use large, bold serif font (like Times or Garamond) in deep black/charcoal for the main quote
- Make the quote text prominently sized - it should be the dominant visual element and easily readable
- Font size should be generous and impactful, filling most of the available space while maintaining readability
- Highlight key impactful words or phrases with realistic yellow highlighter strokes that look hand-drawn with slight transparency and irregular edges
- The highlighter should appear slightly faded and authentic, not perfect digital highlighting

Layout:
- Center the quote with natural, readable spacing that feels handwritten or carefully typed
- Ensure the main quote text is large enough to be easily read on mobile devices
- Place "â€”hara point" in the bottom-right corner using a smaller, elegant script or serif font
- Add "Share this if you agree." at the bottom center in clean, smaller text
- Ensure the text appears naturally embedded on the paper surface with subtle shadows
- Leave appropriate margins but prioritize making the quote text as large and readable as possible

The overall aesthetic should feel like a meaningful quote carefully written or typed on quality paper, photographed with natural lighting. Make it warm, authentic, and tactile - as if you could reach out and touch the actual paper. The quote should be the star of the image with bold, large, easily readable text.

Create a square motivational quote image with an antique parchment background. The aesthetic should include:
- Rich, weathered parchment texture with coffee-stained or tea-stained appearance
- Vintage burn marks or aged spots around the edges
- Deep cream to light brown gradient coloring
- Authentic old manuscript or ancient scroll feel

Typography:
- Use large, ornate serif font (like Trajan or Old English) in dark brown or sepia ink
- Make the text appear hand-lettered with slight imperfections and character variations
- Font should be bold and prominently sized for maximum readability and impact
- Highlight important phrases with gold or amber colored accents that look like illuminated manuscript details
- Add subtle ink bleed effects around letters for authenticity

Layout:
- Center the quote with generous spacing, as if carefully inscribed by a calligrapher
- Large, commanding text that dominates the parchment surface
- Place "â€”hara point" in elegant calligraphy style in the bottom-right corner
- Add "Share this if you agree." in smaller, refined lettering at the bottom center
- Include subtle decorative flourishes or borders around the text area
- Ensure readability on mobile while maintaining the antique manuscript aesthetic

- Text should be bold, modern, and highly readable while maintaining elegance
- Font size should be generous and impactful, filling the space prominently

A cinematic anime-style illustration of a young male character with glowing red eyes, white and black dual-tone hair, and a scar on his face.

The atmosphere is intense, emotional, and symbolic of strength and solitude.

A highly detailed anime-style digital artwork of a male character inspired by Goku in his Mastered Ultra Instinct (MUI) form. He has glowing silver eyes, spiky silver hair, and a calm, intensely focused expression. His tattered orange and blue martial arts outfit flutters dramatically in the wind. A radiant, bluish-white aura surrounds him, with swirling divine energy. The background is epic â€” a shattered battlefield, cosmic space, or storm-lit sky. The mood represents inner peace, strength, and transcendence.

In the center of the image, overlay this motivational quote in bold serif font (Playfair Display or Georgia). Add soft yellow highlight behind important lines:

"{quote_text}"

Ensure the quote is clearly readable, centered, and doesn't cover the character's face. Use soft shadow or blur behind the text to enhance contrast. No watermarks, logos, or unnecessary design elements. Keep the artwork emotionally intense and heroic in anime style.
